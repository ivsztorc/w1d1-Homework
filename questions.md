1. Assign to the value `6` to the variable `number_six`
number_six = 6
2. What is the datatype of `"Matz"`?
array
3. What do the following expressions evaluate to:
  * `"Cool" + "Cool" + "Cool"`
  * `t = "Troy"
    a = "Abed"
    "#{t} and #{a} in the Morning"`
  * `10 * 3`
  =>30
  * `10 ** 3`
  =>1000
  (10**3 means " 10 * 10 * 10" (10 multiplied together 3 times))
  * `10 % 3`
  => 1 (10 % 3 is 1 since 3 goes into 10 3 times with 1 left over)
  * `10 / 3`
  =>3
  * `0.7 + 0.1`
  => 0.799999999999
4. Can you explain why the expressions all give the same result?
  * `"Ronnie " + "Pickering"`
  * `"Ronnie ".+("Pickering")`
  * `"Ronnie ".send(:+, "Pickering")`
5. Please fix the following buggy expressions:
  * `number six = 6`
  number_six = 6

  * `"Maroon" + 5`
   `"Maroon" * 5


  * `ture == flase`
